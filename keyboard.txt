[2][3][10]

Each frame, measure the state of 7 keys (Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter, Shift, Backspace.)
If ((key is pressed) AND (its flag is 0)), move cursor in the direction of that arrow, or choose that character. Then set the key's flag to 1.
If (key is not pressed), set its flag to 0.

Moving the keyboard cursor means incrementing an array pointer.
Shift presses flip between 0[3][10] and 1[3][10].
The array pointer wraps around when bounds are exceeded.

When ENTER is used, the selected character is placed into the next free index in the output array, if there is one.
When BACKSPACE is used, the last character in the output array is replaced with a space and the output array cursor moves one space left if it can.
